		  <h3 class="t-u f-s fs-xs">The Story</h3>
		  <p>This is project 3.</p>

		  <img class="image" src="../assets/day5/chicago.jpg">

		  <p>We rolled into Chicago wanting some sort of urban location
		    under a bridge if possible, and found a great spot near an area called Park No. 556
		    suggested by our friend, photographer, and backer, Ashton Ray Hansen.</p>
		  <p>We were immediately intrigued by the shadows. They inspired Craig to
		    play with shadow borders and force perspective of buildings from another world,
		    while Mike animated Little Buddy as he follows his compass through the
		    streets in search of something new.</p>

		  <h3 class="t-u f-s fs-xs">The Drive</h3>
		  <p>We crossed 5 states and one time zone.
		    (The extra hour was a nice surprise!) We talked a lot during the drive.</p>
		  <p>We talked about the project, which we thought was going pretty well,
		    despite staying up until 4am yet again. We knew this wasn't a sustainable
		    amount of sleep, and we felt it after this 9 hour drive. </p>
		  <p>Mike worked on our postcard rewards, which we sent along the way
		    to 36 backers. We quickly learned postcards take a very long time
		    out of our precious time, especially as we wanted to do our best
		    to write meaningful messages to everyone individually. Our backers
		    became our motivation, everything else melted away. We were making
		    this project for ourselves, with the support of strong group of 125
		    who were watching along, every single day.</p>

		  <p>Little Buddy made it to the big city he was searching for,
		    but what do we do with him now?</p>
