<h3 class="t-u f-s fs-xs">The Drive</h3>
<p>We crossed 5 states and one time zone.
  (The extra hour was a nice surprise!) We talked a lot during the drive.</p>
<p>We talked about the project, which we thought was going pretty well,
  despite staying up until 4am yet again. We knew this wasn't a sustainable
  amount of sleep, and we felt it after this 9 hour drive. </p>
<p>Mike worked on our postcard rewards, which we sent along the way
  to 36 backers. We quickly learned postcards take a very long time
  out of our precious time, especially as we wanted to do our best
  to write meaningful messages to everyone individually. Our backers
  became our motivation, everything else melted away. We were making
  this project for ourselves, with the support of strong group of 125
  who were watching along, every single day.</p>

<h3 class="t-u f-s fs-xs">The Projection</h3>
<p>On the drive to Chicago that we discussed the narrative,
  and started calling our character by the name that had started to stick:
  Little Buddy.</p>

<p>We rolled into Chicago wanting some sort of urban location
  under a bridge if possible, and found a great spot near an area called Park No. 556
  suggested by our friend, photographer, and backer, Ashton Ray Hansen.</p>
<p>We were immediately intrigued by the shadows. They inspired Craig to
  play with shadow borders and force perspective of buildings from another world,
  while Mike animated Little Buddy as he follows his compass through the
  streets in search of something new.</p>

<p>Little Buddy made it to the big city he was searching for,
  but what do we do with him now?</p>

<p class="thanks">Huge thanks to our close friend <a href="http://justinkuzma.com/">Justin Kuzma</a> for filming some behind the scenes.
  Also, thanks for staying out, and giving us a place to sleep. Justin's great.</p>
