<h3 class="t-u f-s fs-xs">The Projection</h3>
<p>To begin the trip, we started organizing our adventure-mobile, and
scouting a few locations in Portland for the first night's projection. It would
set the tone for the entire project, and our Kickstarter backers got to see
an actual glimpse of what they could expect for the next 15 days.</p>

<p>After talking with staff at a local boatyard in the town Craig grew up in,
  we were happy to share DAY 1's location in a sweet little corner near Handy
  Boat Service + Dockside Grill. The pile of bouy's created just the spot
  for our character to start packing his bags.</p>

<p>What a great start to our adventure. The quiet weather was great for
  both projecting and documenting. Some friends & family also ventured out
  to accompany us during the installation despite the late hour. We learned a
  lot about our process, our timing, and enhancing workflow moving forward.</p>

<p>The people at Handy Boat were very accommodating after hearing about our
  project earlier that day, and the location could not have felt more like Maine. </p>

<p>At the end of the night, we recorded the 3D soundscape and could
  feel just how calming standing still for 3-5 minutes really is.
