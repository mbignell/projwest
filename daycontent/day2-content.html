<h3 class="t-u f-s fs-xs">The Day</h3>
<p>Today we spent a good bit of time where Mike grew up,
  soaking in the surrounding woods of Lebanon & Cornish, New Hampshire.
  We were gifted some knowledge of the area from Mike's family,
  hearing a few stories and seeing a few locations that impacted
  tonight's narrative.</p>
<p>Mike's grandfather explained today that farmers would pull up these stones
  while cultivating their land, each farmer placing them at the edge of their
  property, creating low, natural boundaries.</p>

<p>Consequently, the trees near these walls have prospered due to a law
  prohibiting anyone from cutting trees down within 10 feet of a property line.
  Over time, these have created a distinct natural perimeter.</p>
<p>Luckily we didn't need to go far to find a really nice one with
  a plethora of green ferns for tonight's projection. </p>

<h3 class="t-u f-s fs-xs">The Projection</h3>
<p>In the projection, our character reflects on his reasons for leaving home,
  looking across the ferns and the rocks that scattered the light around their imperfections.</p>

<p>The moment of calm at the end of tonight while recording our location's
  ambient audio felt special as we reflected on the day, looking forward to
  tomorrow, when we leave the region we've lived in our entire lives.</p>
