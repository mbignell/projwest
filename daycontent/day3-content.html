<h3 class="t-u f-s fs-xs">The Drive</h3>
<p>Today we're over the border to Vermont, the state where Mike and I first
  became friends. We met as freshmen in our dorm at Champlain College.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Vermont feels like home, so it was nice to visit. A
  fitting location for DAY 3 on our journey, especially after going through
  my home state for DAY 1 and Mike's home state for DAY 2.</p>
<p>It was definitely a powerful realization on our minds today that from
  here on out, we're out of the nest. The comfort of familiarity will be
  gone, the safety off, all feelings that will certainly manifest themselves
  in what we're working on for tonight's projection.</p>

<h3 class="t-u f-s fs-xs">The Projection</h3>
<p>We explored a bunch of covered bridges nearby, as they're not only iconic
   to Vermont, but feel like they match our thoughts of transitioning out to
   a new world, through what feels like big wooden portals.</p>
<p>They were all beautiful locations, but felt tricky to get into, or
  project around, so we decided to explore our other options surrounding the feeling of 'moving forward.'</p>

<p>We walked around the area surrounding Windsor Station, an area that
  felt like a good second plan for us, but it wasn't until we talked in the
  car while heading to another covered bridge, that we realized its full potential.</p>

<p>Our grand scheme was to try and projection map a moving train.</p>

<p>Turns out, not many trains pass through these parts. So we made do with the
  edges of the tracks as our canvas.</p>

<p>We packed the Honda Element like we were on a covert-ops mission. In case
  anyone kicked us out, called the cops, or approached us all sketchy,
  we could close up the back and essentially take off.

<p>Turns out, no one bothered us, but the stress of uncertainty kept us on task.</p>
