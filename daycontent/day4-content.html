<h3 class="t-u f-s fs-xs">The Drive</h3>
<p>We had the long 7 hour drive ahead of us through Vermont and
  all of upstate New York to Buffalo.</p>
<p>After twisting through some small Vermont and New York towns,
  we emptied onto 90 West to a shocking message from our GPS..."CONTINUE ON 90
  WEST FOR OVER 200 MILES." We expect to hear higher numbers as this trip
  progresses...</p>

<p>Along the long drive we talked about our thoughts about moving west and
  what could unfold for our little adventurer after he boarded his
  train to a new frontier.</p>
<p>The drive went pretty fast. Mike sketched as we storyboarded tonight's episode,
and worked on some animations along the way.</p>

<h3 class="t-u f-s fs-xs">The Projection</h3>
<p>Mike and I were both completely taken aback by the sheer scale and presence of
  Buffalo's silo city. We expected this to be a simple episode: large scale,
  industrial, our character entering a giant, new unfamiliar land... </p>
<p>We were wrong in the most fantastic way.</p>

<p>First off, the scale of these behemoths is hard to comprehend.
  They're roughly 190 feet tall.</p>

<img src="/assets/day4/projection4.jpg">

<p>Our thoughts going into this evening, after a long drive, was we'd
  pull back the tricks and do something simple. Big projection on the
  outside of a silo, Little Buddy gets off a train and sees a big city.
  Boom. Easy.</p>

<p>The tricky part, was after an amazing tour from our friend Adam,
  we saw all sorts of interesting projection opportunities, and were
  suddenly back to the storyboard. We had no idea we'd be able to walk
  inside of these things.</p>

<p>The best way to hear our process for DAY 4 is through a great conversation
  we had with some onlookers, then Mike and I ideate further and
  decide on an amazing location, inside silo #42.

<p>The echos that bellow through each silo chamber are difficult to
  capture or even explain. By the end of the night, 3:30am, the silence
  made us awestruck to be in the space that we were, at this moment on our
  journey, feeling calm + thankful + fortunate to be able to bring this
  project to life.

<p>Everyone we met tonight felt super excited for their city and the positive
  growth it has seen in the past couple years. We'll definitely be back to this place.</p>

<p>After another night wrapping at 4am, we've been continually re-evaluating
   our process to ensure we don't fall behind, but don't sacrifice the quality
   we want to deliver, either.</p>
 <p>Next up, our longest drive yet, to Chicago, Illinois.</p>
